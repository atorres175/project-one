      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        One of my hobbies is to look into cars. I was always into cars and
        recently I began to work on cars. I dont have my own personal car,
        sadly. I do know how to do maintenaance work on a car, for example an
        oil change, change out brakes and rotors, rotate tires, etc. The main
        reason I was always so fascinated about cars is just how fast a car can
        go with some work done to it. A lot of people aren't into cars and say
        it's a bad investment. I am not gonna lie I do agree that they are bad
        investments for the person who is not into cars.
