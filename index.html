    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student at Illinois Tech. I am currently a second year
      undergraduate student in the ITM major program. I am from Chicago. I
      attended Solorio Academy High School before choosing to come to Illinois
      Tech. I have always been into technology. The reason I decided to get into
      the ITM major was because ITM is pretty much programming and a bit of
      hardware. I am always eager to learn what technology can do to make
      everyday life more efficient.
